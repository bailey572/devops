# This is the ansible 'hosts' file.
#
# It should live in /etc/ansible/hosts
#
#   - Comments begin with the '#' character
#   - Blank lines are ignored
#   - Groups of hosts are delimited by [header] elements
#   - You can enter hostnames or ip addresses
#   - A hostname/ip can be a member of multiple groups
#
# Because this is target to a system with an active domain name system (DNS) use host names 
# as defined in the docker-compose file since IP addresses will be automatically assigned by docker.
